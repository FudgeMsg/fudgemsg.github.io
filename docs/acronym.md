Fudge stands for:

* **Fast** - The Fudge encoding system is designed to be fast to encode, decode, and process.
This speed should be maintained in both software and hardware processing systems.
* **Unstructured** - Fudge messages are inherently unstructured, and can be used just like a Map.
You can use an external schema to define how you map fields into a Fudge encoded message, but it's not required.
* **Data** - Fudge messages are containers for data.
* **General** - Rather than being a special purpose encoding system for RPC or web technologies,
Fudge messages are generic in nature.
* **Encoding** - The core of Fudge is the [Encoding Specification](specification.html).
If you adhere to the specification and the [type system](types.html), you can process a Fudge message,
whether you use our reference implementations or not.
